            <br> <br><h1>Laws and Sanctions</h1>
            All states have laws requiring schools to respond to bullying. As cyberbullying has become more prevalent with the use of technology, many states now include cyberbullying, or mention cyberbullying offenses, under these laws. Schools may take action either as required by law, or with local or school policies that allow them to discipline or take other action. Some states also have provisions to address bullying if it affects school performance. You can learn about the laws and policies in each state, including if they cover cyberbullying.</div>

</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Schools can have an important role in creating safe and supportive spaces for students to learn and grow.</li>
    <li>Based on a systematic review of available evidence, the Community Preventive Services Task Force (CPSTF) released a recommendation in April 2022 for school-based anti-bullying interventions to reduce bullying experiences and improve students’ mental health.</li>
    <li>These interventions aim to prevent bullying both inside and outside of school.</li>
    <li>School-based anti-bullying interventions can provide group education sessions to help students change how they think and feel about bullying.</li>
    <li>Training for school staff on how to identify and respond to bullying experiences.</li>

   <p>Cyberbullying is a form of bullying that takes place using digital technologies such as social media, messaging platforms, gaming platforms, and mobile phones. It is repeated behavior that aims to scare, anger, or shame those who are targeted. Examples include spreading lies about or posting embarrassing photos or videos of someone on social media, sending hurtful, abusive or threatening messages, images or videos via messaging platforms, impersonating someone and sending mean messages to others on their behalf or through fake accounts</p>
<p>
    If you are worried about your safety or something that has happened to you online, you can seek help by calling your national helpline. If your country does not have a helpline, please urgently speak to an adult you trust or seek professional support from trained and experienced carers.</p>
    <p>
    UNICEF has brought together specialists in cyberbullying and child protection experts and teamed up with Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and Twitter to answer some of the most common questions about online bullying and give advice on ways to deal with it. They have provided answers to questions such as "What is cyberbullying?", "How do you tell the difference between a joke and bullying?", "What are the effects of cyberbullying?", "How can cyberbullying affect my mental health?", "Who should I talk to if someone is bullying me online?", "Why is reporting important?", "I’m experiencing cyberbullying, but I’m afraid to talk to my parents about it. How can I approach them?", "How can I help my friends report a case of cyberbullying especially if they don’t want to do it?", "How do we stop cyberbullying without giving up access to the internet?", "How do I prevent my personal information from being used to manipulate or humiliate me on social media?", "Is there a punishment for cyberbullying?", "Technology companies don’t seem to care about online bullying and harassment. Are they being held responsible?" 
     and "Are there any online anti-bullying tools for children or young people?".</p>
